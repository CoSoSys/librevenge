INSTALLATION:

Unix/Linux
==========

Installation on Unix/Linux should be simple. Simply execute the following 
sequence of commands:

./configure ; make ; su -c 'make install'

Note that this assumes that you have development versions of glib (>=
2.0.0) and libgsf (>= 1.6.0).

LINKS:

glib is available at ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/glib/
libgsf is available at ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/libgsf/

Extensive installation instructions can be found in the INSTALL file.


Windows - Microsoft(tm) Visual Studio/C++
=========================================

A workspace for MSVC6 can be found in the ./projects/msvc/ directory.
This workspace contains a projects file to compile a release version or 
a debug version of libwpd. 

NOTE: Using the MSVC build system will result in a static library only. 
No dll can be created yet using this build system. If you want to create 
a dll, please use the MingW build system (see below for details).


Windows - MingW
===============

See ./projects/mingw/README for details on how to build libwpd using
the mingw build system (http://www.mingw.org/).
