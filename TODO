TODO list for libwpd:

Near Future:
- Support for importing the following WordPerfect 6+ features (in
approximate order of difficulty/time):
	    - More table properties (open)
	    - Headers/Footers (William will do this)
	    - Footnotes/Endnotes (Marc will do this)
- WordPerfect 6+ document export (Marc is planning to start work
on this soon)
- WordPerfect 4.x/5.x document import (open)

Future:
- Support for importing the following WordPerfect 6+ features (in
approximate order of difficulty/time):
	    - Styles (open)
	    - Embedded Objects (need to link up with external libraries to
	      handle WPG graphics, Quattro Pro spreadsheets, etc.: 
	      complicated, but do-able)

Features that the primary maintainers won't implement:
- WordPerfect 4.x/5.x document export (can't do regression testing
without original DOS-based programs, it's an obsolete format, ..)
